Understanding these disparities provides insights into how representation varies and may inform policy recommendations, diversity initiatives, or legal compliance measures.\nThis dataset was published by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and is maintained by Daniel McGregor. As part of its mandate under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission requires periodic reports from public and private employers, unions, and labor organizations that indicate the composition of their workforce by sex and by race/ethnic category. Among these reports, the EEO-1 is collected annually from Private employers with 100 or more employees or federal contractors with 50 more employees. (https://www.eeoc.gov/data/eeo-data-collections)\nSome key variables include: Demographic composition: WHT10 (White), BLKT10 (Black), HISPT10 (Hispanic), ASIANT10 (Asian), AIANT10 (American Indian/Alaska Native), NHOPIT10 (Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander), and TOMRT10 (Two or more races). Industry classification: NAICS-2 and NAICS-3 codes. Geographic regions: Divisions at state and regional levels.\nTo prepare the dataset for analysis, a systematic cleaning process was applied, with the goal of ensuring the data is manageable and meaningful for exploratory and inferential analysis. The following steps summarize the cleaning process:\nAfter doing these steps, we have our cleaned dataaset below:\ncleaned_dataset &lt;- readRDS(\"Employment2017.rds\")\nhead(cleaned_dataset)\n\n

This page will provide an overview of what questions you addressed, illustrations of relevant aspects of the data with tables and figures, and a statistical model that attempts to answer part of the question. You’ll also reflect on next steps and further analysis.\nThe audience for this page is someone like your class mates, so you can expect that they have some level of statistical and quantitative sophistication and understand ideas like linear and logistic regression, coefficients, confidence intervals, overfitting, etc.\nWhile the exact number of figures and tables will vary and depend on your analysis, you should target around 5 to 6. An overly long analysis could lead to losing points. If you want you can link back to your blog posts or create separate pages with more details.\nThe style of this paper should aim to be that of an academic paper. I don’t expect this to be of publication quality but you should keep that aim in mind. Avoid using “we” too frequently, for example “We also found that …”. Describe your methodology and your findings but don’t describe your whole process."

(While not a hard limit, around 5 total figures is probably a good target.)\nDefault lm output and plots are typically not acceptable.\n\nClarity of Explanations\n\nHow well do you explain each figure/result?\nDo you provide interpretations that suggest further analysis or explanations for observed phenomenon?\n\nOrganization and cleanliness.\n\nMake sure to remove excessive warnings, hide most or all code, organize with sections or multiple pages, use bullets, etc.\nThis page should be self-contained, i.e. provide a description of the relevant data."

An asterisk is sometimes used to protect a vulnerable cell and other times to safeguard another at-risk cell.\nNext, we create 3 charts to help with data visualization. The first bar chart helps us visualize the 10 different job types labeled in the dataset by summing up all the rows within the given columns starting with “TOTAL_” and finding their percentages. The second bar chart does something similar, but this time we want to see the proportionality of the 7 given race variables disregarding job types. In a future blog post, we will look into their proportionality with the different job types. The third pie chart looks at the gender variation (male/female0 between all jobs and races.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nemployment_data &lt;- readRDS(\"Employment2017.rds\")\nemployment_data[employment_data == \"*\"] &lt;- NA\n\ntotal_columns &lt;- c(\"TOTAL1\", \"TOTAL2\", \"TOTAL3\", \"TOTAL4\", \"TOTAL5\", \"TOTAL6\", \"TOTAL7\", \"TOTAL8\", \"TOTAL9\", \"TOTAL1_2\")\n\nemployment_data[total_columns] &lt;- lapply(employment_data[total_columns], function(x) as.numeric(x))\n\nemployment_data[total_columns] &lt;- \n  lapply(employment_data[total_columns], function(x) replace_na(x, 0))\n\ntotal_counts &lt;- colSums(employment_data[total_columns], na.rm = TRUE)\n\nproportion_df &lt;- data.frame(Job_Type = names(total_counts), Count = total_counts)\n\nproportion_df$Job_Type &lt;- recode(proportion_df$Job_Type,\n  TOTAL1 = \"Senior Officers and Managers\",\n  TOTAL2 = \"Professionals\",\n  TOTAL3 = \"Technicians\",\n  TOTAL4 = \"Sales Workers\",\n  TOTAL5 = \"Clericals\",\n  TOTAL6 = \"Craft\",\n  TOTAL7 = \"Operatives\",\n  TOTAL8 = \"Laborers\",\n  TOTAL9 = \"Services\",\n  TOTAL1_2 = \"Mid Officers and Managers\"\n)\n\nproportion_df &lt;- proportion_df %&gt;%\n  mutate(Proportion = Count / sum(Count))\n\nggplot(proportion_df, aes(x = Job_Type, y = Proportion, fill = Job_Type)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +  \n  labs(title = \"Proportionality of Jobs by Type\", \n       x = \"Job Type\", \n       y = \"Proportion\") +\n  theme_gray() +  \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +  \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrace_columns &lt;- c(\"WHT10\", \"BLKT10\", \"HISPT10\", \"ASIANT10\", \"AIANT10\", \"NHOPIT10\", \"TOMRT10\")\n\nemployment_data[race_columns] &lt;- lapply(employment_data[race_columns], function(x) as.numeric(x))\n\nemployment_data[race_columns] &lt;- \n  lapply(employment_data[race_columns], function(x) replace_na(x, 0))\n\ntotal_race_counts &lt;- colSums(employment_data[race_columns], na.rm = TRUE)\n\nrace_proportion_df &lt;- data.frame(Race = names(total_race_counts), Count = total_race_counts)\n\nrace_proportion_df$Race &lt;- recode(race_proportion_df$Race,\n  WHT10 = \"White\",\n  BLKT10 = \"Black or African American\",\n  HISPT10 = \"Hispanic\",\n  ASIANT10 = \"Asian\",\n  AIANT10 = \"American Indian or Alaska Native\",\n  NHOPIT10 = \"Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander\",\n  TOMRT10 = \"Two or more Races\"\n)\n\nrace_proportion_df &lt;- race_proportion_df %&gt;%\n  mutate(Proportion = Count / sum(Count))\n\nggplot(race_proportion_df, aes(x = Race, y = Proportion, fill = Race)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +  \n  labs(title = \"Proportionality of Race\", \n       x = \"Race\", \n       y = \"Proportion\") +\n  theme_gray() +  \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +  \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngender_columns &lt;- c(\"MT10\", \"FT10\")\n\nemployment_data[gender_columns] &lt;- lapply(employment_data[gender_columns], function(x) as.numeric(x))\n\nemployment_data[gender_columns] &lt;- \n  lapply(employment_data[gender_columns], function(x) replace_na(x, 0))\n\ntotal_gender_counts &lt;- colSums(employment_data[gender_columns], na.rm = TRUE)\n\ngender_proportion_df &lt;- data.frame(Gender = names(total_gender_counts), Count = total_gender_counts)\n\ngender_proportion_df$Gender &lt;- recode(gender_proportion_df$Gender,\n  MT10 = \"Male\", FT10 = \"Female\")\n\ngender_proportion_df &lt;- gender_proportion_df %&gt;%\n  mutate(Proportion = Count / sum(Count),\n         Percentage = Proportion * 100)  \n\nggplot(gender_proportion_df, aes(x = \"\", y = Proportion, fill = Gender)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", width = 1) +\n  coord_polar(\"y\") + \n  labs(title = \"Proportionality of Gender\", \n       fill = \"Gender\") +\n  theme_gray() +  \n  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n        axis.text = element_blank()) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(Percentage, 1), \"%\")), \n            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we create our cleaned folder.

In our project, being transparent would provide us with any potential limitations in the dataset, such as the lack of representation for smaller sized companies. This exclusion could skew our analysis, if smaller sized companies employ more people from certain demographic groups or adhere to different hiring practices.\nPrivacy and Data Protection\nIn our dataset, the use of asterisks (*) in cells are designed to prevent individual identification, which aligns with the Privacy and Data Protection principle by protecting vulnerable populations. Doing so avoids any attempts to infer or disaggregate data that could lead to re-identifying individuals or small groups, particularly in fields where there is limited representation (e.g., certain job categories or minority groups). This respect for privacy aligns with data equity by fostering a safe environment for marginalized communities.\nInclusivity and Representativeness\nIn our dataset, focusing on medium sized companies disregards the smaller sized companies, which could include potentially significance in minority or gender-represented employment. It is important to include all data as it better captures a representation of the dataset for all demographic groups. By including data on smaller sized companies, we are able to broaden the analysis and provide a more complete picture of industry disparities and representation across all workforce segments. This is particularly significant as many family businesses, which fall beyond the purview of our dataset, tend to be minority owned."

    "text": "Previously in Blog Post 4, we explored two breakdowns of the 2017 dataset, focusing on race and gender. For Blog Post 5, our goal is to extend this analysis to the 2022 dataset, creating similar breakdowns for comparison. This will allow us to visually contrast the 2017 and 2022 data.\nSince we already have 2017 images in Blog Post 3 and 4, this post will be dedicated to 2022 coding scripts.\nIn addition, we have found another dataset that details the wage data associated with all of the jobs listed under the NAICS standard of categorization, logging average hourly wages in October 2023, and August, September, and October 2024. Although the format does not make direct matching to our existing dataset easy, we hope to parse through the data (possibly manually) and use it to assign wage values to our existing race and gender distributions for the different kinds of employment. This information can be useful in exploring potential earning gaps between groups, as well as examining the change in earnings over time. By the time we complete processing the data, we hope to have the information included here as an additional column of our table that we can use in our analysis. Further exploration is warranted in the feasibility of transferring the online table into some kind of csv that can be read into an R script directly.\nHere is the link for the wage data context:

    "text": "These are the steps that you will take today to get started on your project. Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

    "text": "Our initial exploratory data analysis involved some rudimentary breakdowns between the labor statistics and two metrics, particularly race and gender. Utilizing the provided categories of American Indigenous, Asian, Black, Hispanic, Native Hawaiian, two or more, and White, we created a facet showing the racial distributions among the job categories: 1 (senior off and managers), 2 (professionals) 3 (technicians), 4 (sales workers), 5 (clericals), 6 (craft), 7 (operatives), 8 (labors), 9 (service) and 1_2 (mid off and managers). Some more cleaning may be needed to reduce redundant or blank values, but a cursory examination shows approximate parity between various job distributions, with the exception of craft, for which distributions are more uniform. Reducing the seeming uniformity of the different charts may be a matter of controlling for the proportion of the population occupied by each race category, to get more proportionate metrics that are not overshadowed by the gross proportions of each race as represented by the total population. Additionally, a further inquiry into the exact meaning and jobs entailed by the descriptive numbers used by NAICS may be useful, as we find further data sets with descriptive statistics like wages and benefits for particular jobs that need to be linked to the very general categories described by our original dataset.\nWe also performed a similar breakdown by gender, although in this category it was also difficult to detect any significant discrepancies between various jobs and their gender distribution, contrary to popular notions of gender divides in certain jobs, which may warrant a further inquiry into the source and exact meaning of the data. Like with the racial breakdowns, it may also be useful to derive proportions rather than raw numbers to better account for population differences.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n# Read data\ncleaned_dataset &lt;- readRDS(\"../ma-4615-fa24-final-project-group-5/dataset/Cleaned_Employment2017.rds\")\n\n# Pivot to long format, excluding MT and FT\nlong_data &lt;- cleaned_dataset %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = matches(\"^(WHT|BLKT|HISPT|ASIANT|AIANT|NHOPIT|TOMRT)([1-9]|1_2)?$\"),\n    names_to = c(\"Race\", \"JobType\"),\n    names_pattern = \"^(WHT|BLKT|HISPT|ASIANT|AIANT|NHOPIT|TOMRT)([1-9]|1_2)?$\",\n    values_to = \"Count\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(JobType) & !is.na(Race))\n\n# Ensure only specified Job Types are included\nvalid_job_types &lt;- c(\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\", \"9\", \"1_2\")\nfiltered_data &lt;- long_data %&gt;%\n  filter(JobType %in% valid_job_types) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Count = gsub(\"[^0-9.-]\", \"\", Count),  # Clean non-numeric characters\n    Count = as.numeric(Count),            # Convert to numeric\n    Count = ifelse(is.na(Count), 0, Count) # Replace NA with 0\n  )\n\n# Add descriptive labels for Job Types and set factor order\nfiltered_data &lt;- filtered_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    JobTypeLabel = recode(JobType,\n      \"1\" = \"Senior Off and Managers\",\n      \"2\" = \"Professionals\",\n      \"3\" = \"Technicians\",\n      \"4\" = \"Sales Workers\",\n      \"5\" = \"Clericals\",\n      \"6\" = \"Craft\",\n      \"7\" = \"Operatives\",\n      \"8\" = \"Laborers\",\n      \"9\" = \"Services\",\n      \"1_2\" = \"Mid Off and Managers\"\n    ),\n    JobTypeLabel = factor(JobTypeLabel, levels = c(\n      \"Senior Off and Managers\", \"Professionals\", \"Technicians\",\n      \"Sales Workers\", \"Clericals\", \"Craft\", \"Operatives\", \"Laborers\", \"Services\", \n      \"Mid Off and Managers\"\n    ))\n  )\n\n# Plotting\nggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = Race, y = Count, fill = Race)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ JobTypeLabel, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  theme_gray() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Proportional Representation by Job Type and Race\",\n    x = \"Race\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 5)) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprint(long_data)\n\n# A tibble: 3,060,960 × 34\n   Nation        Region Division State CBSA  County NAICS2 NAICS2_Name NAICS3\n   &lt;chr&gt;

    "text": "Origin: This dataset was published by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and is maintained by Daniel McGregor. As part of its mandate under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission requires periodic reports from public and private employers, unions, and labor organizations that indicate the composition of their workforce by sex and by race/ethnic category. Among these reports, the EEO-1 is collected annually from Private employers with 100 or more employees or federal contractors with 50 more employees.\nProblems with Data: The ‘Aggregate’ option shows the sum of employee counts for all other options in the dropdown. This option is offered to maximize the domain of publishable data. Since the ‘Aggregate’ option includes the employee count of alternatives presented within a given dropdown, this option should not be selected if any other option is selected within the same filter. Therefore, uncheck the ‘Aggregate’ option from a filter dropdown while selecting any other option from the same dropdown for generating reports with unduplicated employee counts. With legally mandated reporting, we assume that the data gathered through the census is thorough enough that there are no concerns about selection bias; one possible area of bias is the fact that the data disregards companies with less than 100 employees; this may cause skew with demographics that might have significant employment in smaller companies, like family-owned businesses.\nImportance of Data:\nThe data’s importance is to distinguish the employment disparities between racial groups within the same industry or region. The data de-identification methodology was developed to ensure the safeguarding of identifiable information to fulfill legal requirements under Section 709 (e) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972. Aggregated counts of employers and employees at each dimension (geography x job category x NAICS-2 x NAICS-3 x race x sex) were processed through primary and secondary suppression steps to protect identifying information. The programming codes were applied to each year’s data separately."

    "text": "NYPD Arrest Data (Year to Date)\n\nSource: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrest-Data-Year-to-Date-/uip8-fykc/about_data Columns:19\nRows: This dataset includes a breakdown of arrests in New York City, with thousands of rows representing individual arrests over the course of the current year.\nDescription and Origin: The dataset is manually extracted and reviewed by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning. It includes information such as arrest records, crime type, and suspect demographics. In addition, it provides a breakdown of the police enforcement activity in NYC, giving insights into the types of crimes and the frequency.\nMain Questions: Do arrest patterns vary significantly by race across different boroughs or precincts? Are there disparities in the types of crimes different racial groups are arrested for (felonies vs. misdemeanors)? How do demographic factors like age and sex influence arrest rates by race?\nChallenges: While the dataset has lots of information, it requires us to clean and organize the data effectively when working with location-based data. Additionally, the coordinates need to be interpreted correctly, which makes ensuring accurate data more challenging. Since we are looking at racial disparities, it is essential to recognize that multiple factors influence the data beyond race alone. In other words, we need to control other factors to isolate the specific impact of race on arrest outcomes.\n\nChicago Violence Reduction Data Source: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/violence-reduction-victim-demographics-aggregated\n\nColumns: 11 Rows: Each row is aggregated up to victimization type, age group, sex, race, and whether the victimization was domestic-related. There are 54756 rows.\nDescription and Origin: This dataset contains aggregate data on violent index victimizations at the quarter level of each year (i.e., January – March, April – June, July – September, October – December), from 2001 to the present (1991 to present for Homicides), with a focus on those related to gun violence. This dataset includes only those index crimes that involve bodily harm or the threat of bodily harm and are reported to the Chicago Police Department (CPD). Index crimes are 10 crime types selected by the FBI (codes 1-4) for special focus due to their seriousness and frequency.\nMain Questions: How does the number of victims vary across age groups, sex, and race? Are certain quarters of the year consistently getting more victims with certain demographic perpetrators, and do these patterns change year-over-year? Are domestic-related incidents more prevalent in any particular index crime type or demographic group?\nChallenge: One challenge we foresee is potential coding logic. The quarterly system and large data quantity will be something to work through. Another thing to note is that the dataset is updated daily, so as long as nothing drastic pops up, our analysis will remain smooth running. Working with multiple variables can be confusing, but with time, we should be able to overcome that.\n\nJob Patterns For Minorities And Women In Private Industry, 2017 EEO-1 National Aggregate Report\n\nSource: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/job-patterns-for-minorities-and-women-in-private-industry-2017-eeo-1-national-aggregate-re Columns: 12 (275 total) Rows: 43729\nDescription and Origin: As part of its mandate under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission requires periodic reports from public and private employers, and unions and labor organizations which indicate the composition of their work forces by sex and by race/ethnic category. Key among these reports is the EEO-1, which is collected annually from Private employers with 100 or more employees or federal contractors with 50 more employees.\nMain Questions: How does employment by race (WHT10, BLKT10, HISPT10, ASIANT10, AIANT10, NHOPIT10, TOMRT10) vary across different industries or geographic regions? How does the racial composition of the workforce differ by industry? Are there significant employment disparities between racial groups within the same industry or region?\nChallenges: This dataset would require high-dimensional analysis which may be difficult with what we learned in class. Another challenge is that much of the data is aggregated or has aggregated variable which may make it difficult to make deeper analyses."

    "text": "This week, we cleaned and loaded a dataset closely associated with our employment statistics with racial breakdowns. This new dataset contains many of the NAICS job codes contained in our original dataset, and matched them with wages statistics from the past couple months. For the purposes of our analysis this week, I’ve only looked at the October 2023 data.\nProcessing the data took rather extensive cleanup, requiring a conversion of the Department of Labor’s table into a CSV file, which we did by writing a python HTML web parsing script that could read in the values to a workable CSV file. Then, it was a matter of matching the data, linked by their NAICS codes, to our existing datasets. Once this was accomplished, we were able to perform some rudimentary analysis, seeing some quick breakdowns of wage statistics by the various job categories.\nFor future weeks, we would like to see how this data by job category varies for race and gender, incorporating the other timestamps for average wages to see if wages across jobs and race and gender have changed over time. From this, we might be able to discover things like whether or not wage increases are equally distributed, and how they compare against inflation in the same time period.\n\n#load in our wage data!\n\nwage_data &lt;- read.csv(\"dataset/wage_data.csv\")\n\n# Preview the dataset\nsaveRDS(wage_data, file = \"dataset/wage_data.rds\")\nhead(wage_data)\n\n                                          Industry X2022.NAICS.code Oct..2023\n1                                       Logging(1)             1133     31.20\n2 Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction(1)               21     39.19\n3                        Oil and gas extraction(1)              211     49.38\n4                   Mining (except oil and gas)(1)              212     35.75\n5                                   Coal mining(1)             2121     38.80\n6                              Metal ore mining(1)             2122     43.23\n  Aug..2024 Sept..2024.p.

What are you trying to show? Make sure that you explain your analysis in detail but don’t go into top much mathematics or statistics. The audience for this page is the general public (to the extent possible). Your thesis should be a statement, not a question.\nEach figure should be very polished and also not too complicated. There should be a clear interpretation of the figure so the figure has a clear purpose. Even something like a histogram can be difficult to interpret for non-experts.\n\nCreativity\n\nDo your best to make things interesting. Think of a story. Think of how each part of your analysis supports the previous part or provides a different perspective.\n\nInteractive component\n\nQuality and ease of use of the interactive components. Is it clear what can be explored using your interactive components? Does it enhance and reinforce your conclusions?\n\nThis page should be self-contained.\n\nNote: This page should have no code visible, i.e. use #| echo: FALSE."
