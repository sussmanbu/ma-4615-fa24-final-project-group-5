The primary motivation behind this analysis is to explore disparities in workforce composition by race and ethnicity across industries and geographic regions in the United States. Understanding these disparities provides insights into how representation varies and may inform policy recommendations, diversity initiatives, or legal compliance measures. 

This dataset was published by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and is maintained by Daniel McGregor. As part of its mandate under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission requires periodic reports from public and private employers, unions, and labor organizations that indicate the composition of their workforce by sex and by race/ethnic category. Among these reports, the EEO-1 is collected annually from Private employers with 100 or more employees or federal contractors with 50 more employees. (https://www.eeoc.gov/data/eeo-data-collections)

Some key variables include:
Demographic composition: WHT10 (White), BLKT10 (Black), HISPT10 (Hispanic), ASIANT10 (Asian), AIANT10 (American Indian/Alaska Native), NHOPIT10 (Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander), and TOMRT10 (Two or more races).
Industry classification: NAICS-2 and NAICS-3 codes.
Geographic regions: Divisions at state and regional levels.

To prepare the dataset for analysis, a systematic cleaning process was applied, with the goal of ensuring the data is manageable and meaningful for exploratory and inferential analysis. The following steps summarize the cleaning process:

1. Checking for Missing Values:
Many missing values result from privacy protections (e.g., asterisks in cells). These were replaced with NA to maintain data consistency while noting that these gaps may affect certain analyses. Missing data due to underreporting or suppression in specific categories (e.g., small workforce sizes) were logged for potential exclusion or imputation strategies in future stages.

2. Re-coding for Efficiency
Columns with redundant or overly verbose labels were renamed for clarity (e.g., “White” re-coded to WHT10, “Black or African American” to BLKT10). Job categories were summed across all race and gender subcategories to simplify initial exploratory analysis.

3. Focus on Key Variables
Analysis was narrowed to ~10 job categories listed in the user guide (e.g., Senior Officials and Managers, Professionals, Technicians). Gender was aggregated into male (MT10) and female (FT10) totals to streamline visualizations.

4. Summarizing Data
Totals by race and job category were computed to analyze proportional representation. Separate summaries were created for gender and job category to enable visualization of workforce composition by both axes.

After doing these steps, we have our cleaned dataaset below:

## Rubric: On this page

You will

* Describe where/how to find data.
  * You must include a link to the original data source(s). Make sure to provide attribution to those who collected the data.
  * Why was the data collected/curated? Who put it together? (This is important, if you don't know why it was collected then that might not be a good dataset to look at.
* Describe the different data files used and what each variable means. 
  * If you have many variables then only describe the most relevant ones and summarize the rest.
* Describe any cleaning you had to do for your data.
  * You *must* include a link to your `load_and_clean_data.R` file.
  * Rename variables and recode factors to make data more clear.
  * Also, describe any additional R packages you used outside of those covered in class.
  * Describe and show code for how you combined multiple data files and any cleaning that was necessary for that.
  * Some repetition of what you do in your `load_and_clean_data.R` file is fine and encouraged if it helps explain what you did.
* Organization, clarity, cleanliness of the page
  * Make sure to remove excessive warnings, use clean easy-to-read code (without side scrolling), organize with sections, use bullets and other organization tools, etc.
  * This page should be self-contained.
