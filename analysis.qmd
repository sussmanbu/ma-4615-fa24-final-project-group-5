## Research Motivation and Questions
The primary motivation for this analysis is to better understand the distribution of race and gender within various job types.
Specifically, we are interested in the following:

* How do race and gender representations vary across different job types, particularly in terms of the workforce count for each racial group and gender?

* What insights can be derived from regression models explaining gender and race representation across industries?

## Data Overview
The dataset used for this analysis is the 2017 Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO-1) dataset. It contains workforce representation data broken down by race and gender across the job categories provided by the US Employment dataset. The analysis focuses on the variables that represent the workforce count by race (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, and more) as well as gender (Male, Female) within each job category provided by this website.

## Workforce Representation by Race
To better understand racial representation across the job categories, we begin by summarizing the workforce composition for each category by race.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)

cleaned_dataset <- readRDS("Employment2017.rds")

cleaned_dataset <- cleaned_dataset %>%
  mutate(across(c(WHT10, BLKT10, HISPT10, ASIANT10, AIANT10, NHOPIT10), 
                ~ as.numeric(as.character(.))))

workforce_summary <- cleaned_dataset %>%
  group_by(NAICS2) %>%
  summarise(
    White = sum(WHT10, na.rm = TRUE),
    Black = sum(BLKT10, na.rm = TRUE),
    Hispanic = sum(HISPT10, na.rm = TRUE),
    Asian = sum(ASIANT10, na.rm = TRUE),
    Other = sum(AIANT10 + NHOPIT10, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

long_data <- workforce_summary %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = White:Other, names_to = "Race", values_to = "Count")

ggplot(long_data, aes(x = factor(NAICS2), y = Count, fill = Race)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Workforce Representation by Race/Ethnicity and Industry",
    x = "Industry (NAICS2)",
    y = "Workforce Count",
    fill = "Race/Ethnicity"
  )


```

This bar chart provides insights into how various racial groups are distributed across different industries. It is evident that certain job industries, such as healthcare and social assistance, have higher representation of Black and Hispanic workers, while sectors like technology and finance tend to be predominantly composed of White employees.

## Gender Representation in the Workforce
Next, we turn our attention to gender representation across industries. We summarize the male and female workforce distribution by industry.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

cleaned_dataset <- readRDS("Employment2017.rds")

cleaned_dataset <- cleaned_dataset %>%
  mutate(across(c(WHT10, BLKT10, HISPT10, ASIANT10, AIANT10, NHOPIT10, MT10, FT10), 
                ~ as.numeric(as.character(.))))

workforce_summary <- cleaned_dataset %>%
  group_by(NAICS2) %>%
  summarise(
    White = sum(WHT10, na.rm = TRUE),
    Black = sum(BLKT10, na.rm = TRUE),
    Hispanic = sum(HISPT10, na.rm = TRUE),
    Asian = sum(ASIANT10, na.rm = TRUE),
    Other = sum(AIANT10 + NHOPIT10, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

gender_summary <- cleaned_dataset %>%
  group_by(NAICS2) %>%
  summarise(
    Male = sum(MT10, na.rm = TRUE),
    Female = sum(FT10, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

head(workforce_summary)
head(gender_summary)

long_data <- workforce_summary %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = White:Other, names_to = "Race", values_to = "Count")

gender_long <- gender_summary %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = Male:Female, names_to = "Gender", values_to = "Count")

ggplot(long_data, aes(x = factor(NAICS2), y = Count, fill = Race)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Workforce Representation by Race/Ethnicity and Industry",
    x = "Industry (NAICS2)",
    y = "Workforce Count",
    fill = "Race/Ethnicity"
  )

ggplot(gender_long, aes(x = factor(NAICS2), y = Count, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Gender Representation by Industry",
    x = "Industry (NAICS2)",
    y = "Count",
    fill = "Gender"
  )


```

## Statistical Modeling: Gender Representation
Due to time constraints, we focus on a linear regression model for gender representation. This model predicts male and female workforce representation in the employment data of 2017.


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Prepare data
gender_model_data <- cleaned_dataset %>%
  select(MT10, FT10) %>%
  na.omit()

# Linear regression model
linear_model <- lm(FT10 ~ MT10, data = gender_model_data)

# Summarize the model
summary(linear_model)

# Visualize with regression line
ggplot(gender_model_data, aes(x = MT10, y = FT10)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Linear Regression: Female vs. Male Workforce Representation",
    x = "Male Workforce Count",
    y = "Female Workforce Count",
    caption = "Red line shows predicted trend from linear regression"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

In this context:

X-axis (MT10): Represents the count of male workforce in all job type.
Y-axis (FT10): Represents the count of female workforce in all job type.

The graph shows the relationship between the number of men and women in the workforce across all industries. Each point on the graph corresponds to different major city/regions in the US, with its position determined by the male and female workforce counts for that location. 
Although barely noticable, the trend caters toward the male workforce count which means that there is a higher likelihood that males are overrepresented in the overall job employment in the United States.


## Model Interpretation and Limitations
The results highlight some limitations:

Missing data: The presence of missing values and non-numeric entries in the dataset could skew the results.

Assumptions: The models assume linear relationships between predictors and outcomes, which may not always hold.

-   Clarity Figures
    -   Are your figures/tables/results easy to read, informative, without problems like overplotting, hard-to-read labels, etc?
    -   Each figure should provide a key insight. Too many figures or other data summaries can detract from this. (While not a hard limit, around 5 total figures is probably a good target.)
    -   Default `lm` output and plots are typically not acceptable.
-   Clarity of Explanations
    -   How well do you explain each figure/result?
    -   Do you provide interpretations that suggest further analysis or explanations for observed phenomenon?
-   Organization and cleanliness.
    -   Make sure to remove excessive warnings, hide most or all code, organize with sections or multiple pages, use bullets, etc.
    -   This page should be self-contained, i.e. provide a description of the relevant data.
