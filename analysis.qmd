## Research Motivation and Questions
The primary motivation for this analysis is to better understand the distribution of race and gender within various job types.
Specifically, we are interested in the following:

* How do race and gender representations vary across different job types, particularly in terms of the workforce count for each racial group and gender?

* What insights can be derived from regression models explaining gender and race representation across industries?

## Data Overview
The dataset used for this analysis is the 2017 Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO-1) dataset. It contains workforce representation data broken down by race and gender across the job categories provided by the US Employment dataset. 

This analysis page focuses on the variables that represent the workforce count by race (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, Two or More Races, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and American Indian or Alaska Native) as well as gender (Male, Female) within each job category provided by this website. For simplicity, the initial analysis will combine some minority races (Two or More Races, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and American Indian or Alaska Native) as 'Other'. 

## Workforce Representation by Race
To better understand racial representation across the job categories, we begin by summarizing the workforce composition for each category by race. One important thing to note is that we grouped the data by the NAICS2 variable. 

The 2017 NAICS definitions from the link below were used for the two-digit industry codes. As described in the North American Industry Classification System, United States, 2017, all economic activities can be divided into 20 sectors that are designated by two-digit NAICS codes.

* This bar chart provides insights into how various racial groups are distributed across different industries. Since the US population is predominantly white, the employment counts will be noticably higher in the White category. Nevertheless, it is evident that certain job industries, such as Healthcare and Social Assistance & Accommodation and Food Services, have higher representation of Black and Hispanic workers, while sectors like Finance and Insurance tend to be predominantly composed of White employees. Later in the Analysis process, we will only focus on two industries for simplicity. 

## Gender Representation in the Workforce
Next, we turn our attention to gender representation across industries. We summarize the male and female workforce distribution by industry.

  ))

  "62" = "Health Care and Social Assistance",
  "71" = "Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation",
  "72" = "Accommodation and Food Services",
  "81" = "Other Services (except Public Administration)",
  "92" = "Public Administration"
)

gender_long <- gender_long %>%
  filter(!is.na(NAICS2))

ggplot(gender_long, aes(x = factor(NAICS2, levels = names(sector_labels)), y = Count, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Gender Representation by Industry",
    x = "Industry (NAICS2)",
    y = "Count",
    fill = "Gender"
  ) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = sector_labels) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 5))
```
* This bar chart provides insights into how females and males are distributed across different industries. For females, they dominate the Health Care and Social Assistance industry. For males, they dominate the Manufacturing industry. On the other hand, they share the playground for Retail Trade & Accommodation and Food Services. Fun information!

## Statistical Modeling: Racial Representation
We were curious about the representation of the minority races that we grouped into the "Other" variable, so this linear regression model predicts the racial workforce representation for them in the employment data of 2017. Those race variables were: Two or More Races, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and American Indian or Alaska Native. To make things easier and quicker (for us), we focused on two industries: Construction and Health Care.

For context:

* Each point on the graph corresponds to different major city/regions in the US, with its position determined by the male and female workforce counts for that location. The variable to determine location is named CBSA in the employment dataset. A CBSA code is a five-digit FIPS code that identifies a Core Based Statistical Area, which is a geographic area in the United States that includes a core urban area and surrounding communities. They don't always show, so some numbers were dropped. The CBSA variable will be seen later in the interactive component of this project. 
* Construction's code is 23. 
* Health Care's code is 62.
* The x-axis contains the three different minority races 
* The y-axis displays the proportion of these races in the workforce according to the specific location.

Our Thought Process: 

* Originally, when we started this analysis portion of the data. It was difficult/time-consuming to run more than 3 industries, so we focused on Construction and Health Care.
* We wanted to use multinomial regression; however, RStudio would crash despite many attempts of making the datasets smaller. Therefore, we highlighted the proportions of these minority races according to the workforce sum of only these three races to compare amongst themselves instead. It does bring in the limitation of not looking at the overall though. 

Analysis: 

* It can be assumed that "Two or More Races" has a higher population. For these minority races, "Two or More Races" take up more than 50% in both Construction and Health Care industries. 
* In Health Care, "American Indian or Alaska Native" and "Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander" has a fairly equal average proportion with 19.5 and 16%, respectively. However, in Construction, "American Indian or Alaska Native" jumped in proportion with 31.7% in the minority races while both "Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander" and "Two or More Races" dropped in proportions with 14.8% and 53.5%, respectively. 

## Statistical Modeling: Gender Representation
This linear regression model predicts male and female workforce representation in the construction and healthcare industries from the employment data of 2017.

For context:

* Each point on the graph corresponds to different major city/regions in the US, with its position determined by the male and female workforce counts for that location. The variable to determine location is named CBSA in the dataset. A CBSA code is a five-digit FIPS code that identifies a Core Based Statistical Area, which is a geographic area in the United States that includes a core urban area and surrounding communities. 
* The x-axis is the Male Workforce Count
* The y-axis is the Female Workforce Count

Our Thought Process: 

* Originally, when we started this analysis portion of the data. It was difficult/time-consuming to run more than 3 industries, so we focused on Construction and Health Care.
* In addition, we removed outliers using our best friend, the Interquartile Range, so that the scatterplot could show the trend that the majority of the locations portrayed. 
* Since we only had to compare the two, it's easier to portray them in a scatterplot and look at the trends accordingly. 

Analysis: 

* Just looking at the graph, we can see that the trend for Construction leans heavily toward the Male Workforce Count. The line of best fit suggests that the ratio of having women in construction is 1:9. While the point do show an exponential trend, the general idea that males are more present in the Construction industry do hold. 
* For Healthcare, our line of best fit suggests that the ratio of having men in the healthcare industry is 1:4. The ratio isn't as drastic as the Construction ratio, but still shocking to see because there are male dominated specialties in healthcare. 

## Graphs and Model Limitations
The results highlighted some limitations.

Missing Data: 

* The presence of missing values and non-numeric entries in the dataset could skew the results and cause certain industries to not be presented as clearly. 

Other Limitations: 

* The models assume linear relationships between predictors and outcomes, which may not always hold. 
* The choice to use IQR could also impact predictions for over-populated areas where job representation are likely more diverse.
