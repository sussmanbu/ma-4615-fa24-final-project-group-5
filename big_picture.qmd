## Thesis/Goal

In 2022, the U.S. workforce continued to show significant disparities when it comes to job types, race, and gender. This article takes a closer look at those trends, aiming to understand how these factors impact representation and wage distribution across different sectors. Our goal is to uncover patterns of inequality, while also highlighting where progress has been made and where challenges still exist.

By analyzing the relationship between race, gender, and employment type, we gain a better understanding of the ongoing systemic inequalities within the workforce. This isn’t just about comparing how jobs are distributed across different racial and gender groups; it’s also about looking at how wages and job roles are shifting over time. 

Since the United States is predominantly white, we can expect to see trends skewed in that direction; however, we will do our best to provide analysis outside of population count.

## The Story Behind the Data

Do you ever think about how different racial and gender groups are represented in the workforce, how wages are distributed across various job types, and how these trends have evolved over time? Probably not, but we did. By examining data across job sectors (using NAICS categories) and comparing it by race and gender, we get a clearer understanding of where inequality persists, as well as where certain groups are either underrepresented or overrepresented.

We highlight key insights such as:

- **Which industries are dominated by certain races or genders?**
- **The persistence of the wage gap?**
- **Which job types have seen the most growth for specific racial and gender groups?**

## Visualizing Workforce Trends

![Proportionality of Race](images/Proportionality_of_race.png)

According to the 2022 Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO-1) dataset, the United States workforce is split into these 7 races: American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Hispanic, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific islander, Two or more races, and White.

![Proportionality of Jobs by Type](images/Proportionality_of_jobs_by_type.png)


Using the same information, we also present the proportionality of the Job Type Categories the 2022 Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO-1) dataset focused on: Clericals, Craft, Laborers, Mid Officers and Managers, Operatives, professionals, Sales Workers, Senior Officers and Managers, Services, and Technicians.

Lastly, this is the split of males and females in the United States.

Now, we get to the fun stuff. 


![Proportional Representation by Job Type and Gender](images/Proportional_representation_by_job_type_and_gender.png)

This plot visualizes the proportional representation of genders across various job types. Each facet represents a different job category (e.g., Senior Officers and Managers, Professionals, Technicians, etc.), with the y-axis showing the percentage of each gender within that job type. The percentages are calculated by dividing the count of each gender by the total count for the respective job type, allowing us to see how each gender is represented proportionally within each job category. The x-axis represents gender, and the bars display the percentage of men and women in each job type. The y-axis is adjusted for each facet to better accommodate the varying percentage scales across different job categories. The plot is designed to help identify gender disparities across job categories and offers a clear comparison of gender distribution for each job type.

Similarly, this plot displays the workforce count representation of different races across various job types. Each facet represents a specific job category (e.g., Senior Officers and Managers, Professionals, Technicians, etc.). Within each facet, bars show the count of workers from different racial groups (e.g., White, Black, Hispanic) for that particular job type. The counts are visualized as bar heights, making it easy to compare the racial distribution within each job category. The x-axis represents the race categories. The y-axis is adjusted for each facet, with "free_y" scaling to accommodate different ranges for each job type. This plot helps identify racial disparities in job type representation and allows a visual comparison of racial diversity across job categories.

Since one dataset isn't enough, we incorporated a second that talks money.

From the link below, you will be brought to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics that provides hourly and weekly earnings for employees according to the NAICS job industry standards. 

[Click here to visit the website](https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/ceseeb3a.htm)

Within each of the 10 Job Categories, there may or may not be more precise job types for them. The NAICS2 variable brings out that for us to look at. 


![Average Wage by NAICS2 Name](images/Average_Wages_By_NAICS2_Name.png)

This plot displays the average wages across various sectors, with each bar representing a different industry sector. The sectors are listed on the vertical axis, and the corresponding average wage is shown on the horizontal axis. This visualization provides insights into how wages differ between sectors, highlighting which industries offer higher or lower average compensation. 

I don't know about you, but working in finance and insurance sounds like a great deal!

Unfortunately, our wage dataset cannot be merged with the 2022 data to look for correlations between racial/gender disparities in job industries with income rates, so we present a deeper look into even more niche job titles from the wage dataset.

![Average Wage by NAICS3 Name](images/Average_Wage_by_NAICS3_Name.png)

This bar chart illustrates the average wages across different NAICS3 sectors, with each bar representing a sector. The sectors are displayed on the vertical axis, while the horizontal axis shows the average wage for each sector as of October 2023. The chart is flipped horizontally for better readability, allowing for easier comparison of wage levels across sectors. This visualization highlights wage disparities between job industries at a more granular NAICS3 level.

Is data science the key to securing a high-demand job in today's rapidly evolving workforce???

### Interactive

This interactive allows you to input two variables: CBSA and Race. It'll, then, output the information from the employment data for different job types across various races for the years 2017 and 2022. It's a fun interactive that lets the user visually compare the employment counts between 2017 and 2022. Try it out!
