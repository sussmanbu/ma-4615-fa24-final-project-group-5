## Thesis/Goal

In this analysis, we delve into the trends of the U.S. workforce as observed in 2022, focusing on disparities in job types, race, and gender. Our goal is to provide insights into how these factors influence representation and wage distributions across different sectors. We aim to explore patterns of inequality and highlight where progress has been made — and where challenges remain.

By analyzing the relationship between race, gender, and employment type, we uncover valuable insights into systemic inequalities that persist within our workforce. Our exploration not only compares job distributions but also examines the evolving wage trends and occupational shifts.

## The Story Behind the Data

This analysis tells the story of how various groups are represented in the workforce, how wages are distributed across job types, and how these elements have shifted from 2017 to 2022. By looking at data across job sectors (NAICS categories) and comparing them by race and gender, we gain a clearer picture of where inequality still exists, and where certain groups are underrepresented or overrepresented.

We highlight key insights such as:

- **Which industries are dominated by certain races or genders.**
- **The wage gap and its persistence in 2022.**
- **Which job types have seen the most growth for specific racial and gender groups.**

## Interactive Components

To enhance your understanding of the data, we’ve incorporated interactive elements that allow you to explore the dataset in more detail. These components are intuitive and easy to use:

- **Explore the Data**: You can filter by job category, race, gender, and year to see how specific groups have changed over time. This helps to uncover hidden patterns in the workforce that static charts might miss.

- **Gain Deeper Insights**: The interactive components let you explore complex relationships in the data. For example, by clicking on a particular industry, you can dive into the wage distribution or racial representation within that sector.

These features make it easier to see the implications of the data for different demographic groups and draw your own conclusions based on what interests you most.

## Video Recording

As part of our project, we’ve created a **4-minute video** that walks you through the key findings and demonstrates how to use the interactive components on this page. This video is available in the README.md file on our Github repository, where you can view a quick summary of our analysis and explore the interactive elements firsthand.

### Interactive

You will also be required to make an interactive dashboard like [this one](/flex/flex.html).

Your Big Data page should also include a small interactive dashboard. The dashboard should be created either using Shinylive, as below. This interactive component should in some way support your thesis from your big picture page. Good interactives often provide both high-level understanding of the data while allowing a user to investigate specific scenarios, observations, subgroups, etc.




```{shinylive-r}
#| standalone: true
#| viewerHeight: 640 # You will have to adjust this to fit everything


library(shiny)
library(tidyverse)
options("readr.edition" = 1) # keep this to ensure you can download the data


# Define UI for app that draws a histogram ----
ui <- fluidPage(

  # App title ----
  titlePanel("Hello Shiny!"),

  # Sidebar layout with input and output definitions ----
  verticalLayout(
      # Input: Slider for the number of bins ----
      sliderInput(inputId = "bins",
                  label = "Number of bins:",
                  min = 1,
                  max = 50,
                  value = 30),

      # Output: Histogram ----
      plotOutput(outputId = "distPlot")

  )
)

# Define server logic required to draw a histogram ----
server <- function(input, output) {
  # The URL below has to point to a dataset on your github pages website
  # I recommend creating a small-ish rds file that has only the data relevant to 
  # the interactive.
  data <- read_rds("https://sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-final-project-quarto/dataset/loan_refusal_clean.rds")
  
  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    ggplot(data, aes(x = refusal_rate)) +
      geom_histogram(bins = input$bins + 1)

  })

}

# Create Shiny app ----
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

## Rubric: On this page

You will

* Title
  * Your big picture page should have a creative/click-bait-y title/headline that provides a hint about your thesis.
* Clarity of Explanation
  * You should have a clear thesis/goal for this page. What are you trying to show? Make sure that you explain your analysis in detail but don't go into top much mathematics or statistics. The audience for this page is the general public (to the extent possible). Your thesis should be a statement, not a question.
  * Each figure should be very polished and also not too complicated. There should be a clear interpretation of the figure so the figure has a clear purpose. Even something like a histogram can be difficult to interpret for non-experts.
* Creativity
  * Do your best to make things interesting. Think of a story. Think of how each part of your analysis supports the previous part or provides a different perspective.
* Interactive component
  * Quality and ease of use of the interactive components.
Is it clear what can be explored using your interactive components?
Does it enhance and reinforce your conclusions?
* This page should be self-contained.
  
**Note**: This page should have no code visible, i.e. use `#| echo: FALSE`.  




## Rubric: Other components

### Video Recording

Make a video recording (probably using Zoom) demonstrating your interactive components.
You should provide a quick explanation of your data and demonstrate some of the conclusions from your EDA.
This video should be no longer than 4 minutes.
Include a link to your video (and password if needed) in your README.md file on your Github repository. You are not required to provide a link on the website.
This can be presented by any subset of the team members.


### Rest of the Site

The main title of your page is informative.
Each post has an author/description/informative title.
All lab required posts are present.
Each page (including the home page) has a nice featured image associated with it.
Your about page is up to date and clean.
You have removed the generic posts from the initial site template.
