For the final stages of our project, we aim to deepen our exploratory data analysis by 
making additional visual representations that might reveal previously hidden trends. 
We'll focus particularly on plots, paying special attention to the CBSA column, which 
offers rich geographical insights spanning multiple states like 
Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton, PA-NJ. It may be difficult to look for a separating factor 
to get data based on states, but we will work for that. 

Our tentative thesis is as follows: “Disparities in occupational representations and 
earnings persist across race and gender, as evidenced by labor data from 2017 and 2022, 
with notable variances in specific job categories and evolving wage trends suggesting 
systematic inequalities.” The analysis reveals significant inequalities across job 
categories and wage structures. Notably, sector-specific trends demonstrate nuanced 
patterns of workforce representation and growth.

For example, the "HISPT" sector experienced notable proportional growth in job 
categories including Crafts, Technicians, Laborers, Services, and Senior Officers & 
Managers. Despite a smaller absolute job increase compared to the "WHT" sector, the 
growth rates were particularly striking. Similarly, the "BLKT" sector showed expansion 
in Laborers, Technicians, and Services roles. We will look into further tests to prove these trends if possible with our dataset. 

There was consistency across all sectors regarding the increased proportional 
representation of women, especially in key professional categories such as Senior 
Officers and Managers, Technicians, Crafts, Services, and Mid-level Officer positions.
To enhance the project's visual communication, we plan to leverage advanced data 
visualization tools. Specifically, we'll use the Plotly package in R to improve figure 
quality and the DT package to create tables. 

Our refinement strategy included several critical improvements:
-Clarifying axis labels
-Ensuring scales are intuitive and readable
-Adding explanatory captions and annotations
-Strategically highlighting key findings to improve interpretability

These enhancements will help make our complex data more accessible and meaningful to the
general audience. We will also continue working on the wages dataset to see if we can 
provide visual representation to the audience.
