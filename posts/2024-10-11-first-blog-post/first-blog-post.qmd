  1. NYPD Arrest Data (Year to Date) Source: NYPD Arrest Data Columns:
  19 Rows: This dataset includes a breakdown of arrests in New York City,
  with thousands of rows representing individual arrests over the course
  of the current year. Description and Origin: The dataset is manually
  extracted and reviewed by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning.
  It includes information such as arrest records, crime type, and suspect
  demographics. In addition, it provides a breakdown of the police
  enforcement activity in NYC, giving insights into the types of crimes and
  the frequency. Main Questions: Do arrest patterns vary significantly by
  race across different boroughs or precincts? Are there disparities in the
  types of crimes different racial groups are arrested for (felonies vs.
  misdemeanors)? How do demographic factors like age and sex influence arrest
  rates by race? Challenges: While the dataset has lots of information, it
  requires us to clean and organize the data effectively when working with
  location-based data. Additionally, the coordinates need to be interpreted
  correctly, which makes ensuring accurate data more challenging. Since
  we are looking at racial disparities, it is essential to recognize
  that multiple factors influence the data beyond race alone. In other
  words, we need to control other factors to isolate the specific impact
  of race on arrest outcomes.
  
  2. Chicago Violence Reduction Data Source:
  https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/violence-reduction-victim-demographics-aggregated
  Columns: 11 Rows: Each row is aggregated up to victimization type, age
  group, sex, race, and whether the victimization was domestic-related.
  There are 54756 rows. Description and Origin: This dataset contains
  aggregate data on violent index victimizations at the quarter level of
  each year (i.e., January – March, April – June, July – September, October
  – December), from 2001 to the present (1991 to present for Homicides), with
  a focus on those related to gun violence. This dataset includes only those
  index crimes that involve bodily harm or the threat of bodily harm and
  are reported to the Chicago Police Department (CPD). Index crimes are 10
  crime types selected by the FBI (codes 1-4) for special focus due to their
  seriousness and frequency. Main Questions: How does the number of victims
  vary across age groups, sex, and race? Are certain quarters of the year
  consistently getting more victims with certain demographic perpetrators,
  and do these patterns change year-over-year? Are domestic-related
  incidents more prevalent in any particular index crime type or demographic
  group? Challenge: One challenge we foresee is potential coding logic.
  The quarterly system and large data quantity will be something to work
  through. Another thing to note is that the dataset is updated daily,
  so as long as nothing drastic pops up, our analysis will remain smooth
  running. Working with multiple variables can be confusing, but with time,
  we should be able to overcome that.
  
  3. Job Patterns For Minorities And
  Women In Private Industry, 2017 EEO-1 National Aggregate Report Source:
  https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/job-patterns-for-minorities-and-women-in-private-industry-2017-eeo-1-national-aggregate-re
  Columns: 12 (275 total) Rows: 43729 Description and Origin: As part of
  its mandate under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended,
  the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission requires periodic reports from
  public and private employers, and unions and labor organizations which
  indicate the composition of their work forces by sex and by race/ethnic
  category. Key among these reports is the EEO-1, which is collected annually
  from Private employers with 100 or more employees or federal contractors
  with 50 more employees. Main Questions: How does employment by race (WHT10,
  BLKT10, HISPT10, ASIANT10, AIANT10, NHOPIT10, TOMRT10) vary across different
  industries or geographic regions? How does the racial composition of the
  workforce differ by industry? Are there significant employment disparities
  between racial groups within the same industry or region? Challenges: This
  dataset would require high-dimensional analysis which may be difficult with
  what we learned in class. Another challenge is that much of the data is
  aggregated or has aggregated variable which may make it difficult to make
  deeper analyses.
